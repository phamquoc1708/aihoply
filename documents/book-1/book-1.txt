He didn't see me then. He was with some friends. 
One of the boys was his brother, I think: they had the 
same blue eyes, the same mouth and nose, nearly the 
same hair. His brother and one of the boys with him 
tried to catch the sea birds and he smiled at them. Then 
they came and stood near us, and they talked about the 
small boats on the sea. I watched him over Louise's 
head all the time! 
It was a big new boat with cafes, shops, a cinema 
and a disco. In the evening Louise and 1 went to the 
disco together. We had a Coke and listened to the 
music and watched the dancers. But he wasn't there. 
Then suddenly a tall boy in a black and white shirt 
came in â€” it was him! He was with a friend. They 
stopped and looked slowly at all the people in the 
disco. It was dark in there and he stood and looked for 
a long time. 
But then I looked up and there was a second tall boy 
in a blue and white shirt at the door of the disco, with 
the same eyes and the same mouth and nearly the same 
hair.
